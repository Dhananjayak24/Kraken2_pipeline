# Classification using built database
Once you are ready with your kraken2 database, now you can perform classification using the below command.
**TIPS:** Keep path of you raw fastq file and database copied somewhere in system.
There are many options available for classification. I prefer you to go through the standard github repository for output flags https://github.com/DerrickWood/kraken2/blob/master/docs/MANUAL.markdown 

Command to perform classification
(nohup kraken2 --db <path to database> --threads <num> --classified-out <file for unclassified seqs> --classified <file for classified seqs> <path to the raw fastq files> > <final outputfile.txt>)
```bash
nohup kraken2 --db <path to db> --threads 12 --classified-out NB34_000363532_classified.fq --unclassified-out NB34_000363532_unclassified.fq <path to raw fastq file> > <outputfile>
```
We can also use --use-names to get taxa name for classified seqs
```bash
nohup kraken2 --db <path to db> --threads 12 --use-names <path to raw fastq file> > <outputfile>
```
Most of the time we need to generate standard Kraken2 output for further analysis
Report generation:
```bash
nohup kraken2 --db <path to db> --threads 12 --report NB34_000363532_report.txt <path to raw fastq file>
```

Once you successfully complete the report generation, its better to copy or move the files from server to local disk.

For this open WSL in your system and then write this command with your specific details
Before this ensure that you are in the correct directory  in the local system(anyhow you can mention specific path in local system also in place of ./)
**Open WSL in local machine, try connecting to the server using IP and password in the following way**
```bash
scp <username>@<IP address of server>://<path to your reports in server>/*.txt ./
```
## Sample Report Output Format
Kraken 2 offers two formats of sample-wide results. Kraken 2's standard sample report format is tab-delimited with one line per taxon. The fields of the output, from left-to-right, are as follows:

1. Percentage of fragments covered by the clade rooted at this taxon
2. Number of fragments covered by the clade rooted at this taxon
3. Number of fragments assigned directly to this taxon
4. A rank code, indicating (U)nclassified, (R)oot, (D)omain, (K)ingdom, (P)hylum, (C)lass, (O)rder, (F)amily, (G)enus, or (S)pecies. Taxa that are not at any of these 10 ranks have a rank code that is formed by using the rank code of the closest ancestor rank with a number indicating the distance from that rank. E.g., "G2" is a rank code indicating a taxon is between genus and species and the grandparent taxon is at the genus rank.
5. NCBI taxonomic ID number
6. Indented scientific name

The scientific names are indented using space, according to the tree structure specified by the taxonomy.
